                            While I was working at Igloo Studio, I had the
                            opportunity to help storyboard a music video project
                            for none other than Nadech Kugimiya, the Thai
                            superstar, who, for a special reason, wanted to
                            create a music video using animation as a medium. I
                            am glad that the studio accepted the project.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            So we start with the script. It's short and simple.
                            It's a journey of a man in space, trying to find a
                            suitable planet to live on. Did I mention that this
                            project is a love song music video? Yes. He's hiding
                            his intention in plain sight.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Some of the key moments were highlighted and
                            requested early on, so we know what to incorporate
                            into the music video. Additionally, the casting and
                            designs reflect the real ones. Nadech treated them
                            as Easter eggs for fans to discover themselves. We
                            had to include those as well.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The funny story I've heard is that when Nadech saw
                            this first version of the animatic, he was quite
                            shocked. He asked the team if this was the final
                            product. We reassured him that it was not,
                            explaining that it was just the beginning of the
                            process. He seemed quite relieved.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Some of the shots needed extra guidance because the
                            nature of 3D animation workflow, camera work and
                            character positions, is quite different from 2D
                            animation.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            When developing complicated shots, we had to use
                            different techniques to capture what the director
                            wanted. Some shots could use only After Effects to
                            get the point across, but others involved more
                            complex camera work and multiple messages that
                            needed to be conveyed.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For example, the camera in this shot needs to
                            capture the ground and then fly up into the sky.
                            Characters are flying in swirly patterns, then
                            stopping at the key pose in the sky. If we were to
                            draw all the angles, it might work, but it would
                            take a long time. So, I used Blender as a tool to
                            bring this idea to life for the next team to follow
                            along with. It is 3D in nature, but I can still work
                            quickly and understand what will be needed in this
                            shot.

                        <p>
                            With that, the end result is quite what I had
                            expected. It is beautiful and effectively conveys
                            all the messages to the viewers.
